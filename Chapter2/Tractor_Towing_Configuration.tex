\section{Tractor Towing Configuration}
The single body dynamics model derivation is based on the current towing configuration and tractor used by the South Pole Traverse. Currently, Caterpillar and AGCO MT865 tractors and a sled system is used. A picture and diagram of the setup are shown in Figures \ref{fig:South_Pole_Traverse_Tractor_and_Sled_Configuration} and \ref{fig:Top_View_Diagram_South_Pole_Traverse} respectively. The sled system consists of four sleds each supporting two, 10,000 kg bladders each.
